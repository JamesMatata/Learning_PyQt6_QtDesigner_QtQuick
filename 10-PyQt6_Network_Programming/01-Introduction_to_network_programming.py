# In PyQt6 the networking module is called the QtNetwork module.
# The QtNetwork module contains classes for writing networked applications using TCP/IP, UDP or Http.
# It also allows you to build client-servers and peer-to-peer applications.
## Key Concepts
# - Sockets - A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines. PyQt6 provides the QTcpSocket and QUdpSocket classes for TCP and UDP communication.
# - Sever-Client Model - In this model, the server listens for incoming connections from clients. The client connects to the server and sends data.
# - Peer-to-Peer Model - In this model, two or more applications communicate with each other without a central server.
# - Http - The QNetworkAccessManager class provides a high-level API for sending network requests and receiving responses.

# - Signals and Slots - PyQt6 uses signals and slots to handle events. Signals are emitted when an event occurs. Slots are functions that are called in response to signals.

# - Data Serialization - Data serialization is the process of converting data structures or objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted. PyQt6 provides the QDataStream class for serializing data.

# - Error Handling - PyQt6 provides the QNetworkReply class for handling network errors. You can use the error() and errorString() methods to get information about the error.
