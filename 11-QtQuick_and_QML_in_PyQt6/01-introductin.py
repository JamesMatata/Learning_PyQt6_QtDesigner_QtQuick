QML (Qt Modeling Language):
It's a high-level language that allows you to create user interfaces quickly and in a declarative manner. 
You describe what you want to see (such as buttons, text fields, images) and how they should behave in your application. 
Unlike traditional imperative programming, you declare the properties of an object and leave the framework to handle how 
those properties are rendered and updated.

QtQuick:
QtQuick is a framework that makes use of QML to provide a set of ready-made components and functionality for user interface design. 
It's particularly great for modern UIs that need to respond to user interaction in an intuitive way. QtQuick provides components 
like buttons, text inputs, lists, and more, making it easier to implement interactive and dynamic interfaces.
